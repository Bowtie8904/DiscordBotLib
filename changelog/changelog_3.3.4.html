<h1>Discord Bot Lib v3.3.4</h1>

<h3>Bot class</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improved Bot#sendMessage(), Bot#sendListMessage() and Bot#sendPlainMessage() methods
        <ul>
            <li>Further suppressed error messages. This like 403 erros should no longer see the light of day.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>GuildCommandHandler class</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removed the thread invocation to execute the command as this is pointless since the entire method is called from a separate thread.</li>
</ul>
